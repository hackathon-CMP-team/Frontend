## 📑 About

- This project was developed during a two-week hackathon, and it is called Tap Cash.

- Tap Cash is an E-wallet application that allows users to make transfers, request money, and generate a virtual visa card that lasts for 24 hours.

- Additionally, we introduced a sub-card for children that is supervised by their parents, and the child cannot proceed with any transaction without their parent's approval.
